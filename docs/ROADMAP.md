## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

| Risk                         | Mitigation                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Firebase costs exceed budget | Optimize queries, implement aggressive caching, monitor usage |
| ML model accuracy is poor    | Start with simpler algorithms, collect more data, iterate     |
| App Store rejection          | Follow guidelines strictly, have backup plan for features     |
| Performance issues           | Profile early and often, test on old devices                  |

### Product Risks

| Risk                   | Mitigation                                                |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low developer adoption | Outreach to indie communities, incentivize early adopters |
| Low user engagement    | A/B test features, iterate based on analytics             |
| Competing apps         | Focus on unique value prop (indie-focused, swipe UX)      |
| Negative feedback      | Act on feedback quickly, transparent communication        |

### Timeline Risks

| Risk                               | Mitigation                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Features take longer than expected | Prioritize ruthlessly, cut scope if needed      |
| Bugs delay launch                  | Build in buffer time, thorough testing early    |
| Team member unavailability         | Document everything, cross-train where possible |
